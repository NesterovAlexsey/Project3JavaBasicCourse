# Vocabulary training program

## 1. User view

### ***1.1 Description***

It is known that knowing words in any foreign language plays a key role in mastering it. Your
communication level and knowledge assessment always depend on your vocabulary. This program is
designed to be a simple, daily training for learning new words. I recommend adding 10 new words here
every day and you won't even notice how significantly your level of German knowledge will increase.

The program has a basic set of 100 words of B1 level, but it is also possible to delete words and
add new ones. You can also use the program as a dictionary or view the entire list of entered words.

The most important thing is the ability to train your word knowledge. You will be given a random
word from the list of not yet learned or partially learned words. Your task is to correctly write
the translation of this word in the console. If you answer correctly 3 times, the word will be
learned and will no longer appear in your training.

Of course, you have the ability to view the results of your efforts. The program will show you the
number of learned words (more than 2 correct answers) and the number of words in the learning
process (1 or 2 correct answers), as well as visually display the percentage of learned/in
progress/yet to be learned words.

And, of course, your results will not disappear after closing the program, everything is saved.
